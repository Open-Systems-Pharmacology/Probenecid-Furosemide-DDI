## Probenecid-Furosemide-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Probenecid-Furosemide-DDI studies for model evaluation
 
### Repository files
Within this repository, we share a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the [Probenecid](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Probenecid-Model)-[Furosemide](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Furosemide-Model)-DDI, including the respective observed data. For further details and documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
 
### Version information
PK-Sim Version 9.0.
