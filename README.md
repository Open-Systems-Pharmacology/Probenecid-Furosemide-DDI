## Probenecid-Furosemide-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Probenecid-Furosemide-DDI studies for model evaluation
 
### Repository files
Within this repository, we share a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Probenecid-Furosemide-DDI, including the respective observed data. For further details and documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
 
### Version information
PK-Sim Version 8.0.

### Code of conduct

Everyone interacting in the Open Systems Pharmacology community (codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, mailing lists etc...) is expected to follow the Open Systems Pharmacology code of conduct.
